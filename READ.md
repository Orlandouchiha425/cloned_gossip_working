~~~~~What is supposed to do------
I attempted to create a copy of Reddit
Users can go to the main page and see all the posts made
if you click on Home, it will take them to the main page. if you click on the link named neighborhood watch, it doesnt do anything at the moment
but you can create new post
if user selects the post, they can view the post, edit and delete
users can even add their own images with url( was trying to get multer npm workng to upload and attempted to add geolocation )
the likes icon does not do nothing, i attempted to add even listener however is a challenge in jsx file. but i searched online and found information below

Getting Started:
If you want to avoid typing new posts, i have created a seed file. Please go to localhost8000/seed or web: https://gossipnews.herokuapp.com/seed
Once is done, reload the page to localhost3000/gossip  web :  https://gossipnews.herokuapp.com/
Then you can add posts, edit, delete
Important: if you need to add an image, please use online images ex: https://imgur.com/ 
and add Direct Links


Go to Direct Live Website below

I want to add the following( Add geo location API so it can only show posts in your area and i want to make Multer work or something related to it, so i can upload images from your device. I want to get my like button to work and make it so the "Top"Liked posts will show as a corousel. i had the corousel working but i had to deleted since i coulnt get my like button to work.
